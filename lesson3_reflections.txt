When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people or when working on a project on multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have a better understanding of the changes made by differen people and to prevent accidental overwrites.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are for collaborating and implementing (experimental) features. Clones are used to share a repository between different people or
machines. Forks are clones of existing repositories which link back to the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can check the difference between the remote and local repositories offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would use another hosting platform as a git server. Some of the functionality that GitHub provides would be lost however (pull requests,
easy web interface, etc.).

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

It is much safer to make changes in dedicated feature branches instead of directly in the master branch. This gives you and other people the
opportunity to review changes before merging them into the master branch (main body of code).
