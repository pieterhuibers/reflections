When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people or when working on a project on multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have a better understanding of the changes made by differen people and to prevent accidental overwrites.
